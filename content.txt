TEAM EARTHUTSAV
(festive cheer with eco care)
Team EarthUtsav is an initiative led by youth power members to promote sustainability in every celebration and every festival, where every occasion of joy spread love and protects the environment!
ABOUT US- MEET THE CHANGE MAKERS
EarthUtsav is a student led social initiative launched by four young change makers- Anushka, Angel Dua, Soham Mukherjee and Vanya Saluja, who aim to protect the environment during occasions of joy by encouraging mindful consumption and encouraging communities to reuse, recycle and rethink as we celebrate tradition.
OUR VISION-
Our vision is to redefine the spirit of celebration. We dream of a word where every festival spreads happiness without harming the environment, where tradition meets sustainability and joy becomes an act of care for the planet.
We want to inspire people to celebrate festivals, birthdays and weddings in eco-friendly ways with less waste and more love.
through small creative actions, we hope to build a community that celebrates responsibly and sustainably.

OUR MISSION-
At team earthutsav, we empower youth and communities to ensure that tradition and sustainability walk hand in hand. From makeshift coconut candles to wedding veils for under privileged brides, we spread awareness about environmental impacts and promote sustainable alternatives at every step of the way. Through education, collaboration and shared responsibility, we strive to achieve our vision of sustainability and tradition existing in the same bubble of love, where joy becomes an act of care for our planet. 

OUR THEME: ECO-FRIENDLY CELEBRATIONS

Eco-friendly celebrations are all about enjoying festivals, birthdays, weddings, and other special moments in ways that don’t harm the planet. Instead of using plastic decorations, chemical-filled colors, or firecrackers, we believe in celebrating using biodegradable materials, reducing waste, and making sustainable choices. Our message is simple: festive cheer today shouldn’t cost the Earth tomorrow. 

Team EarthUtsav chose this theme because while celebrations bring happiness, they often leave behind a trail of waste and pollution. After festivals like Diwali or Holi, air quality drops drastically, and lots of non-biodegradable waste piles up in landfills. Through our efforts, we hope to inspire everyone to celebrate consciously, by reusing decorations, saying no to single-use plastics, and switching to greener alternatives. With our awareness drives, creative posters, and hands-on activities, we’re redefining what it means to celebrate, i.e. making every festivity both joyful and kind to the Earth.
